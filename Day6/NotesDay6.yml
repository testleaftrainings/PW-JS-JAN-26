Notes:
-----

Select options used based on priority:
-----------------------------------------


1. Select By Value :
-Stable and less likely to change since the value is often connected to your backend

  await page.selectOption(`#createLeadForm_dataSourceId`,{value:"LEAD_DIRECTMAIL"})

2. Select By Label :
Tend to change due to business requirements / geography
Example travel name of places in your website


3. Select BY Index :
When ever there is not change in the order of your dropdown can go for select by index 

Non-select tags
---------------
1. Locate your dropdown and use click()/ enter the value
2. locate the particular option from the dropdownlist - clickit



Ways of handling dropdown:
----------------------------

| Method     | Stability | Readability | Use When...                         |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| By value |   High    |   Low       | Most reliable, backend-driven IDs   |
| By label |   Medium  |   High      | UI is stable or for quick checks    |
| By index |   Low     |   Low       | Only if no other way /staticorder |

Assertions :
-----------
Use expect() library for assertions

expect library meaning - to expect something

5 types of Assertions in Playwright:
--------------------------------------

1. Generic Assertion.

Assertions on variables or values, not directly tied to UI elements.

toBe – Checks strict equality (===) between two values.
toEqual – Checks deep equality of objects/arrays/values.
toContain – Checks whether a value/substring exists inside an array/string.
toBeTruthy – Passes if the value is considered true in JavaScript.
toBeFalsy – Passes if the value is considered false in JavaScript.
toBeGreaterThan – Checks if a number is greater than another number.


2. Locator Assertion.
Assertions performed on UI elements indentified using locators

- toBeVisible()- checks if the element is visible on the page.
- toBeEnabled()- checks if the element is enabled and can be interacted with.
- toBeEditable()- checks if the element is editable, such as input fields.

3. Page Assertion.

Assertions made on the page object , such as URL and title.

toHaveURL(url) - checks if the current page URL matches the expected URL.
toHaveTitle() - checks if the page title matches the expected title.

4. Snapshot Assertions. --> Visual Regression testing
Assertions comparing two visual elments from the UI particular

5. API refernce Assertions. --> REST API 
Assertions used check your API reponses 


Based on Functionality 
--------------------

1. Auto retry assertion.
2. Non-retry assetion.


Hard Assertion.--> It will abruptly stop your execution.
Soft Assertion. --> Informing that he assertion has failed and it will not stop execution it will move to next  part of execution.

Negating matchers

In general, we can expect the opposite to be true by adding a .not to the front of the matchers:

expect(value).not.toEqual(0);
await expect(locator).not.toContainText('some text');

Maximizing the browser window in Playwright:
-----------------------------------------------

{
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { browserName:"chromium", 
        viewport:null, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
        },
      },
    }, 

    Firefox :
    ----------

        name: 'firefox',
      use: { browserName:"firefox", 
        viewport:{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
        }
}
},
    }, 

    Webkit :
    ----------

        name: 'webkit',
      use: { browserName:"webkit", 
        viewport:{ width: 1920, height: 1080 }, // disable the deafult 1280x720
        launchOptions:{
          args:['--start-maximized'],
        }
}
},
    },






--------------------------------------------------------------
timeouts in playwright :
----------------------

1. test timeout:
-----------------
Timeout for a specific test execution.

test.setTimeout(20000)

2. assertion timeout:
----------------------
Timeout for assertion of a weblelement.

In config file below timeout :
expect:{
timeout:15000
}

In script : 
await expect(locator).toHaveText('Submit',{timeout:15000})

3. Action timeout :
--------------------
Timeout for each and every action performed like click(), fill()

In config mention under "use" :
use:{
actionTimeout:15000
}

In script : 
await page.locator("#password").fill("crmsfa",{timeout:20000})

4. GLobal timeout :
-----------------------
Implemented when we execute in pipleines.

In config file under "timeout" :

globalTimout : 60*60*

1️⃣ What await really does

await only waits for a Promise to resolve.

await page.click("#login");


This only means:

“Wait until the click command is sent to the browser”

It does NOT mean:

Button is visible

Button is enabled

Page finished loading

Element exists

It only waits for Playwright to issue the command.

2️⃣ What Playwright Auto-Wait does

Before Playwright performs any action like:

await page.click("#login")


Playwright internally waits until:

✔ element exists
✔ element is visible
✔ element is enabled
✔ element is not covered
✔ page is stable

Only then it clicks.

This is Auto-Wait.
