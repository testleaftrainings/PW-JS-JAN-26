//int x =123 --> in other programming languages

//In typescript it is done through inference

let variable : string = "Hello" // Explicit inference
variable = "123"

let variable2 = "Hello" // Implicit inference
variable2 = "123"

//Typescript is static typed 
//Javasript is dynamically typed
