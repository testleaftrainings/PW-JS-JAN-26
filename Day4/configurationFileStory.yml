## 🏠 Playwright Config as a Kitchen Story

### Welcome to the Playwright Kitchen

Imagine you own a **restaurant kitchen** 🍳
This kitchen is your **`playwright.config.ts`** file.

Before cooking starts, you decide:

* How many chefs you have
* What dishes to prepare
* Whether cooking happens one-by-one or simultaneously
* Which kitchen tools are allowed
* How mistakes are handled

That’s exactly what this configuration file does.

## The Kitchen Setup (Global Configuration)

### 🗂️ `testDir: './tests'`

> **Where are the recipes stored?**

(A recipe is most commonly defined as a set of instructions used to prepare or cook a specific dish)

This tells the chefs:

> “All recipes (test files) are kept in the **`tests` folder**.”

No confusion. So that chef knows where to look.

---

### ⚡ `fullyParallel: true`

> **Can multiple dishes be cooked at the same time?**

Yes ✅
If there are enough chefs, they can cook **multiple recipes simultaneously**.

Without this, chefs would unnecessarily wait.
---

## 👨‍🍳 Workers = Chefs in the Kitchen

### 🧑‍🍳 `workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 1`

This is the **most important concept**.

### 🔹 Case 1: Only **1 Chef** in the Kitchen

```
workers = 1
```

You have:

* 1 chef
* 3 dishes (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

👉 That **single chef** must:

1. Cook Chromium dish 🍝
2. Then Firefox dish 🍕
3. Then WebKit dish 🍣

➡️ **Execution is sequential**
➡️ Slower but controlled

> “One chef, many dishes — one after another.”

---

### 🔹 Case 2: **3 Chefs** Available

```
workers = 3
```

Now:

* Chef 1 → Chromium
* Chef 2 → Firefox
* Chef 3 → WebKit

➡️ **All dishes prepared at the same time**
➡️ Faster delivery 

> “More chefs, faster service.”

---

## 📊 Reporter = The Feedback Board

### 📄 `reporter: 'html'`

After cooking, the manager wants:

* What went well
* What failed
* Which dish took more time

So you hang a **beautiful HTML report** on the notice board 🧾
Anyone can open it and review the kitchen performance.

---

## 🧰 Shared Kitchen Tools (`use` block)

These are tools **every chef gets**.

### 👀 `headless: false`

> Chefs cook **in front of you**

You can *see* everything happening.
Perfect for learning and debugging.

---

### 🧵 `trace: 'on-first-retry'`

> “If a dish fails, record the cooking process 🎥”

Only record when something goes wrong — not every time.

Smart and efficient.

---

## 🌍 Projects = Types of Dishes (Browsers)

Now comes the **menu**.

projects: [
  chromium,
  firefox,
  webkit
]

These are **the same recipe** cooked in **different styles**:

| Project  | Kitchen Meaning     |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Chromium | Cooked on Gas Stove |
| Firefox  | Cooked on Induction |
| WebKit   | Cooked on Wood Fire |

Same ingredients, different outcomes.

---

### 🔁 How Workers + Projects Work Together

### 🔹 1 Worker + 3 Projects

```
Chef 1:
  → Chromium
  → Firefox
  → WebKit
```

➡️ Sequential
➡️ Slower
➡️ Easy to observe

---

### 🔹 3 Workers + 3 Projects

```
Chef 1 → Chromium
Chef 2 → Firefox
Chef 3 → WebKit
```

➡️ Parallel
➡️ Faster
➡️ Real-world testing

---

> **“Projects decide *WHAT* to cook,
> Workers decide *HOW FAST* we cook.”**

## One-Liner Summary :

* `playwright.config.ts` → Kitchen rules
* `tests` → Recipes
* `projects` → Different browsers (same test)
* `workers` → Number of chefs
* More workers → Faster execution
* Fewer workers → Sequential execution
