This range is:
-9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991

If you go beyond this range — like using:

let num = 9007199254740992;

JavaScript **can't guarantee accuracy**, and you'll get the `ts(80008)` warning in TypeScript because the value might be **rounded**, **inaccurate**, or **unexpected**.
