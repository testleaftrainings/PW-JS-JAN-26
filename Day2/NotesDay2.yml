NotesWeek1Day2 :
----------------

Important terms to understand : 

1. Declaration :
---------------

Declaration means creating a variable "x" and giving it a name using a keyword "var".

This is to tell JavaScript that a variable exist (creating memory space) in the name of x using the keyword "var".

🔹 No value is given yet and hence we term it as undefined.

var x;


Analogy : Declaration is like buying an empty lunch box and writing your name on it.
👉 Lunch box exists, but it’s empty.

------------------------------------

2. Assignment
--------------

Assignment means giving a value to an already declared variable.

x = 100;

Analogy : Assignment is like putting food into an already bought lunch box.
👉 Now the lunch box has food.

--------------------------------------

3. Initialization 

Initialization means declaring a variable and assigning a value to it at the same time.

var x = 100;

Analogy : Initialization is like buying the lunch box AND putting food in it immediately.
👉 Filling the empty named lunch box in one step.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the var keyword, we can store different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, booleans, undefined, and null.
Each of these represents a single value and is called a Primitive Data Type.

When we want to store a collection of values, like adding multiple products to a shopping cart, we use Arrays and Objects.

Array → Collection of values (list)

Object → Collection of values with names (key–value pairs)

****************************************************************************************************************

Real-life Ananlogy on the difference between var,let,const :

🟨 var — You can rename the box and change the food
🍱 Lunch box analogy

Declaration → Buying a lunch box and naming it x
Redeclaration → Writing the name x again on the same lunch box
Assignment → Putting food in the box
Reassignment → Replacing the food with something else

With var, the lunch box is flexible — you can rename it again and again and change what’s inside.

var rules :

| Aspect                    | Redeclaration | Reassignment |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| What repeats?             | Variable name | Value        |
| Uses `var` keyword again? | Yes           | No           |
| Changes memory?           | No            | No           |
| Allowed with `var`?       | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        |

Example:
-------

var x = 10;   // Declaration + assignment
var x = 20;  // ✅ Redeclaration allowed

x = 30;      // ✅ Reassignment allowed


------------------------------------------------------------------------

🟦 let — You can change food, but you cannot rename the box
🍱 Lunch box analogy

Declaration → Buying a lunch box and naming it y
Redeclaration → ❌ Not allowed (you cannot write the name y again on the same box)
Assignment → Putting food in the box
Reassignment → Replacing the food with something else

| Aspect                    | Redeclaration | Reassignment |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| What repeats?             | Variable name | Value        |
| Uses `let` keyword again? | Yes ❌ (Error) | No           |
| Changes memory?           | No            | No           |
| Allowed with `let`?       | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes        |

Example :
--------

let y = 10;   // Declaration + assignment
let y = 20;  // ❌ Error (redeclaration not allowed)

y = 30;      // ✅ Reassignment allowed

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🟥 const — You cannot change the box or the food
🍱 Lunch box analogy

Declaration → Buying a lunch box and naming it z
Assignment → Putting food in the box (must be done immediately if not throws error in const)
Redeclaration → ❌ Not allowed
Reassignment → ❌ Not allowed

Once food is placed, that lunch box becomes sealed forever 🔒

| Aspect                      | Redeclaration | Reassignment |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| What repeats?               | Variable name | Value        |
| Uses `const` keyword again? | Yes ❌ (Error) | No ❌ (Error) |
| Changes memory?             | No            | No           |
| Allowed with `const`?       | ❌ No          | ❌ No         |

Example :

const z = 50;  // Declaration + assignment is mandatory
const z = 60; // ❌ Error (no redeclaration)

z = 70;       // ❌ Error (no reassignment)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One-line summary:

var → Rename the box & change the food

let → Keep the same box, change the food

const → Same box, same food forever

***************************************************************************************************************

Hoisting :
---------

Hoisting is JavaScript’s behavior of scanning the entire .js file before execution, 
collecting all var declarations, and creating memory for them with the value undefined before any line of code runs.

Example

console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;


What JS internally does during the scan phase:

a → undefined   (memory created)

Then during execution phase:

a = 10

So this works because:

The declaration is hoisted, but the value is assigned later

------------------------------------------------------------------------

🟦 Hoisting with let

JavaScript scans the whole file, finds let declarations, and creates memory for them — but does NOT assign undefined.
They stay in a Temporary Dead Zone (TDZ) until the declaration line is executed.

Example
console.log(a); // ❌ ReferenceError
let a = 10;

What happens internally

Scan phase

a → <uninitialized>   (TDZ)

Execution phase

let a = 10  → now value is assigned

Because a has no value yet, accessing it before the declaration is illegal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
🟥 Hoisting with const

JavaScript scans the whole file, creates memory for const, but keeps it uninitialized in TDZ — and it must be assigned immediately at the declaration line.

Example
console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError
const b = 20;

Internally

Scan phase

b → <uninitialized>   (TDZ)


Execution phase

const b = 20 → assigned once, then locked 🔒

------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY ON HOISTING for var,let and const :
------------------------------------------

var is hoisted with undefined,
let and const are hoisted too — but locked in TDZ until their line executes.

-----------------------------------------------------------

THE STORY BEHIND HOISTING :
---------------------------
Why did JavaScript introduce hoisting for var?

Because JavaScript was designed to be forgiving and beginner-friendly.

In 1995, JavaScript was created in just 10 days for non-programmers writing small scripts inside HTML pages.
People wrote code like this:

total = price + tax;
var price = 100;
var tax = 10;


In strict languages like Java or C, this would crash.
But JS designers wanted this to work without errors.

So they said:

“Before running the code, scan the whole file and register all var variables first.”

That decision created hoisting.
